# Sell Your Home In 30 Days
#### San Antonio, TX edition

Selling a home can be a daunting process.  People need to juggle selling their home for as much as they can get for it, with waiting for the right home buyer.  Many people have a timeline of how long they can wait to get the price they want.  This project attempts to find the price at which the seller should expect to sell their house if they want it sold within thirty days.  

This is an imperfect process and there are many factors that go into how long a house stays on the market.  Some factors that I expect to be important in predicting price and whether the house will sell in thirty days:
1. The time of year the house is being sold
2. The location of the house
3. The house size

There are also some things that will not be in the data that could potentially affect the home sale:
1. Pictures of the house
2. The condition of the house
3. Contingencies of the sale

## Exploratory Data Analysis

First things first, the data was explored to find out what is being worked with.  **Data Density**

#### Features in Original Data

The data was obtained from www.redfin.com and downloaded using a free user account.  This data does not represent the total number of houses sold but does represent over half of the houses sold. A distribution of houses across most of San Antonio was attempted, but there will be some areas that are not represented in the data.
